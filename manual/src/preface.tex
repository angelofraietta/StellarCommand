    \textit{Stellar Command} is a software system that integrates \textit{stellarium} planetarium software with online astronomical data acquisition through \textit{VizieR} database of astronomical catalogues \cite{ochsenbein2000vizier}. Stellar Command can be used as an interface mechanism for correlating music and sound generation, allowing stellarium to be used as both a direct input interface for performance or composition, and as a remotely controlled derivative multimedia display output.
