	Abstract = { NIMEs typically focus on novelty but the cost of novelty is
	often to
	ignore other non-functional requirements and concerns such as
	usability or security. Digital security has probably not been a
	concern for performers due to the duration of their performances and
	lack of disrespectful hackers, known as crackers, in attendance
	carrying the appropriate equipment and software necessary to hack a
	performance. Yet many modern NIMEs could be hacked from smart-phones
	in the audience. The lack of security hardening makes NIMEs an easy
	target --- but a question arises: if hacking can interrupt or modify
	a performance couldn't hacking itself also be performance? Thus
	would music hacking, live-hacking, be similar to live-coding? In
	this paper we discuss how NIMEs are in danger of being hacked, and
	yet how hacking can be an act of performance too.

In this paper we will discuss the hardware components used in the arduino board, the software used to programme it (Arduino board) with the guide on how to write and construct your own projects, and a couple of examples of an arduino project, This will give you the overall view of an arduino uno, that after reading this paper you will get the basic concept and use of an arduino uno.},

	series = {Synthesis digital library of engineering and computer science},
	abstract = {BeagleBone Black is a low-cost, open hardware computer uniquely suited to interact with sensors and actuators directly and over the Web. Introduced in April 2013 by BeagleBoard.org, a community of developers first established in early 2008, BeagleBone Black is used frequently to build vision-enabled robots, home automation systems, artistic lighting systems, and countless other do-it-yourself and professional projects. BeagleBone variants include the original BeagleBone and the newer BeagleBone Black, both hosting a powerful 32-bit, super-scalar ARM Cortex A8 processor capable of running numerous mobile and desktop-capable operating systems, typically variants of Linux including Debian, Android, and Ubuntu. Yet, BeagleBone is small enough to fit in a small mint tin box. The "Bone" may be used in a wide variety of projects from middle school science fair projects to senior design projects to first prototypes of very complex systems. Novice users may access the power of the Bone through the user-friendly BoneScript software, experienced through a Web browser in most major operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, or the Linux operating systems. Seasoned users may take full advantage of the Bone's power using the underlying Linux-based operating system, a host of feature extension boards (Capes) and a wide variety of Linux community open source libraries. This book provides an introduction to this powerful computer and has been designed for a wide variety of users including the first time novice through the seasoned embedded system design professional. The book contains background theory on system operation coupled with many well-documented, illustrative examples. Examples for novice users are centered on motivational, fun robot projects while advanced projects follow the theme of assistive technology and image-processing applications.},

In this paper we will discuss the hardware components used in the arduino board, the software used to programme it (Arduino board) with the guide on how to write and construct your own projects, and a couple of examples of an arduino project, This will give you the overall view of an arduino uno, that after reading this paper you will get the basic concept and use of an arduino uno.},

	abstract="The Guarani Indians in South Brazil have a sophisticated system of thought about the cosmos. Presented here are some elements of their cosmology and cosmogony and the influences of the heavenly bodies in this people's everyday life, which have been collected in ethnographic research in the first decade of the 21st century. The main themes of cosmology and the origin of the Sun, Moon, and Earth are described, approximating this anthropological research to ethnoastronomy and cultural anthropology discussions. This research seeks to analyze comparatively this cosmological concept with other indigenous cosmological systems and to compare them with the Western cosmological system, thus including it in studies of cultural astronomy.",
